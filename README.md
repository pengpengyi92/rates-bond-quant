FICC Rates Bond Quant is an educational Python project for fixed-income
interest-rate bond analytics. It now includes a Python quant engine, a FastAPI
backend API, and a TypeScript / Next.js frontend dashboard.

It focuses on the core mechanics of rates-bond quant work:

```text
bond cash flows
-> bond pricing
-> Macaulay duration
-> modified duration
-> convexity
-> rate-cut / rate-hike scenario
-> PnL estimation
-> multi-maturity comparison
```

This is a public-safe GitHub project. It uses simplified examples and synthetic
inputs to demonstrate the mechanics, not proprietary trading views.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Interest-rate bonds are one of the most important areas in FICC. Before talking
about strategy, portfolio construction, or AI research agents, we need a clean
understanding of:

- 📊 how coupon bond prices are computed
- 📉 why bond prices move opposite to yields
- 📈 why duration approximates first-order rate sensitivity
- 📐 why convexity matters for larger rate moves
- ⏳ why long-maturity bonds are more sensitive to rate changes
- 💰 how portfolio PnL responds to rate-cut and rate-hike scenarios

This repo turns those ideas into a small, runnable Python demo.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Run the demo:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
py demos/run_demo.py
```

Run tests:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
py -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Run the FastAPI backend:

```powershell
py -m pip install -e ".[web]"
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
py -m uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

Run the TypeScript frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Interactive Web Demo

The web demo turns the quant engine into a product-like educational dashboard.

  <img src="assets/ficc-teaching-dashboard.png" alt="FICC web demo teaching dashboard" width="760">
</p>

The dashboard includes:

- 💰 a 10 billion RMB default notional scenario
- 📉 configurable yield-shock scenarios
- 📊 estimated P&L by maturity
- 📈 duration comparison chart
- 📐 convexity comparison chart
- 📚 educational explanations for duration, convexity, and rate sensitivity

## ✨ What The Project Shows

The demo compares 1Y, 3Y, 5Y, 10Y, and 30Y coupon bonds under:

```text
10bp rate cut
10bp rate hike
50bp rate cut
50bp rate hike
```

It estimates:

- 📊 price
- 📈 Macaulay duration
- 📉 modified duration
- 📐 convexity
- 💵 estimated price change
- 💰 estimated portfolio PnL
- 🌐 interactive dashboard output

## 📖 Example Interpretation

A long-duration bond has higher interest-rate sensitivity.

For the same rate cut:

```text
30Y bond price impact > 10Y bond price impact > 1Y bond price impact
```

A rate cut usually increases bond prices, while a rate hike usually decreases
bond prices.

Convexity improves the approximation when the yield move becomes larger.

## 📚 Educational Scope

This project covers:

- 🏦 interest-rate bonds
- 💵 cash-flow discounting
- 📊 bond pricing
- 📈 Macaulay duration
- 📉 modified duration
- 📐 convexity
- 🧪 yield-change scenario analysis
- 💰 portfolio PnL estimation
- 🧭 multi-maturity comparison
- 🌐 web-based educational visualization

It does not cover:

```text
credit bonds
default risk
derivatives
swaps
options
high-frequency trading
live trading
real portfolio optimization
```

## 🛡️ Public-Safe Boundary

This repo does not include:

- proprietary bank materials
- internal research documents
- client information
- real trading positions
- private market views
- live trading instructions

## 🧭 Positioning

This is a research-engineering project, not a trading system.

Defensible claim:

```text
I built an educational FICC rates bond quant project that implements bond
pricing, duration, convexity, rate-shock scenarios, PnL estimation, and
multi-maturity comparison in Python.
```

Do not claim:

```text
production rates trading system
live bond portfolio optimizer
bank internal research engine
validated real-money strategy
```
